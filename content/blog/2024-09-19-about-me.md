I am Josipa Celanovic, 2BA Media & information design student at LUCA school of arts.
<!--more-->
<br>

I grew up and studied in Montenegro. I graduated from _Petar Lubarda_ highschool with a degree in graphic design.
In November 2022 I moved to Belgium with the goal of doing a Bachelors degree.
I work for a small NGO from Montenegro and in my free time I like to discover new techniques and find out how to incorporate them into my designs.
