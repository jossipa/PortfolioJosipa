>This assignment was all about getting familiar with how typography works. We were asked to make a poster, a book spread, a slide and an instagram post for a quote from one of the great designers, talking about great design. The quotes are coming from the book _Designer Maker User_ by Alex Newson, Eleanor Suggett and Deyan Sudjic. The idea was to test out at least two versions: one with and the other without illustrative material. The final work had to consist of minimum one of these versions.

<br>

Typography is something seemingly simple which in reality requires a lot of reviews and fine tuning which I found quite fun in this assignment. I think it's a great example of how compact the art of graphic design is.


For this assignment we had to shape a quote into a poster and animation. I got a quote of _Peter Saville_
